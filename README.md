## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS animations
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

<!-- TODO -->

### Continued development

I hope to have more projects that integrate CSS animations, because, although they are somewhat difficult to manage without an animation library, they can be great for user experience. I definitely have to seek out more resources and guides to better manage keyframes and I probably should pick up [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/).

Aria attributes are another area that I need to continue to learn about. Especially on a project like this one, where there is a lot of updating content, it is important that low vision and blind users are able to get the information as it changes. I included an aria-live attribute on elements that have updating text content, but they don't seem to be announced every time. I wil continue to learn about this attribute and if there are any quirks when using aria attributes with React.
